Great trick. much better than bare git repo.
Just one thing. stow doesn't assume HOME ( ~) directory as the target directory ( by default it is the parent of the current directory ), can be changed with --target flag.
eg: dotfiles in ~/Documents/dotrcs ( and this is my pwd )
stow neovim  # would symlink things relative to ~/Documents.
stow --target=/home/gabriel neovim  # will symlink relative to HOME (~).
